# WC Just Bought

A WordPress plugin that displays a popup notification in the bottom-right corner showing recent WooCommerce purchases. The popup cycles through the latest 10 orders, showing customer initials with dots, country flags, product name and image (both clickable), and how long ago the purchase was made.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or higher
- WooCommerce 3.0 or higher
- PHP 7.2 or higher

## Installation

1. **Upload the plugin files** to the `/wp-content/plugins/wc-just-bought` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

2. **Activate the plugin** through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

3. **Ensure WooCommerce is installed and activated** - the plugin requires WooCommerce to function.

4. The popup will automatically start displaying on your website's frontend!

## How It Works

1. The plugin fetches the latest 10 completed or processing orders from WooCommerce.
2. Automatically filters out refund orders to prevent errors.
3. For each order, it extracts:
   - Customer's first and last name initials (formatted with dots, e.g., "J.M.")
   - Shipping country name and country code
   - Country flag from flagcdn.com
   - First product from the order
   - Product URL (for clickable links)
   - Product image
   - Time since the order was placed
4. The popup appears 3 seconds after page load and cycles through orders every 3 seconds.
5. Each popup is displayed for 10 seconds before transitioning to the next one.
6. Users can click the product name or image to view the product page in a new tab.
7. Users can close the popup by clicking the √ó button.

## Display Format

The popup displays purchases in a natural, readable format:

```
[J.M.] from Italy bought
Premium Leather Bag
2 hours ago
```

Both the product image and product name are clickable links that open the product page in a new tab.

## Customization

### Debug Mode

Enable or disable console logging by editing the DEBUG constant in `assets/js/script.js`:

```javascript
const DEBUG = false; // Set to true to enable debug logging
```

When enabled, you'll see detailed information about:
- AJAX requests and responses
- Order data being loaded
- Any errors that occur
- Flag loading status

### Timing Settings

You can modify the timing by editing the JavaScript constants in `assets/js/script.js`:

```javascript
const DISPLAY_DURATION = 5000; // Show each popup for 5 seconds
const CYCLE_INTERVAL = 10000; // Wait 10 seconds between popups
const INITIAL_DELAY = 3000; // Wait 3 seconds after page load
```

### Styling

Customize the appearance by editing `assets/css/style.css`. The popup uses modern CSS with:
- Flexbox layout
- CSS animations (slide in/out)
- Hover effects on clickable elements
- Responsive design
- Customizable colors and dimensions
- Country flag styling

Key elements you can customize:
- `.wc-just-bought-initials` - The initials badge
- `.wc-just-bought-flag` - Country flag styling
- `.wc-just-bought-product-name` - Product name styling
- `.wc-just-bought-product-link` - Link hover effects

### Number of Orders

To change the number of orders displayed, edit the `limit` argument in `wc-just-bought.php` (default is 10).

## Privacy Considerations

The plugin is designed with privacy in mind:
- Only shows customer initials with dots (e.g., "J.M." - not full names)
- Uses shipping/billing country (public information)
- No sensitive customer data is exposed
- Product information is already public on your store

- Logs errors to WordPress error log (when available)
